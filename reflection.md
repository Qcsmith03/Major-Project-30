# advice to self
 - go for something with a bit more of a challenge.
 - add a bit more polish
 - try for a game, not a PSA
 - get music to loop
 - I should comment more, it will help me out when i try to look around the code. it would also help Mr. Schellenberg.

# hardest part of the project
 - it would be setting up the music.
 - getting the mouse clicking to work.

# did i complete my proposal
 - yes, I did complete my proposal. I had bets, what to bet screen, horses, rats, music, an oh no screen, a transition screen, and even slots. 
 - next time i should try to make my proposal longer.

 # what are you most proud of
 - I am proud of my music, it was hard to get a file that would play, then it would overlap when playing so that didn't work. but i moved things around and finally got it working. next I would like to get it to loop.
 - I also enjoyed making the slots, It had all of the things I found interesting while still haveing a bit of challenge. the slots involved millis, a transition, and some randomizatrion.
